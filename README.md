* As a user, I don't want to search for jobs. I want my agent to present me with jobs that are a good fit for my skillset. I don't want to put in the work to figure out where to work.
* As a user, my agent should track my applications and application materials. I should be able to ask and see all my applications, resumes used for those applications, and job descriptions.

# High Level Overview
* Our application helps job seekers not only find jobs, but tailorâ€™s their application materials specifically for those jobs with the click of a button.
* We pull key words out of the job post and compare those against the contents of an extended resume. Then we select the best fitting lines within the extended resume and condense it to an ATS optimized 1 page resume.
